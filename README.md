# 🩸 Blood Bank Management System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a **Blood Bank Management System** using SQL. It includes schema design, data insertion, querying, and advanced operations such as joins, views, subqueries, and stored procedures. The project was completed as part of a SQL internship assignment to demonstrate real-world database skills.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a relational database schema for managing blood donations, requests, staff, and inventory.
- Insert and manage data using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- Write advanced queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, and aggregation.
- Create reusable SQL blocks like views and stored procedures.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **DB Browser for SQLite** (for schema creation and testing)
- **MySQL Workbench** (for stored procedures and functions)
- **dbdiagram.io** (for ERD design)
- SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
